Simple crontab file necessary for automatic updates. 

You may need to remove lines that do not apply to your installation.  For example, if you do not need dynamic dns, remove that line.

Change <rig-monitor dir> to your base dir (e.g. /usr/home/pi) and run the following command from whatever user you wish to run the automated update scripts (usually same user as base install).

crontab crontabfile
